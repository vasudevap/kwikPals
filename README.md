# kwikPal: the NoSQL Social Network API

## DESCRIPTION

Facebook too much for you!?  Checkout kwikPal - a simple, get-to-the-point social network built on an ultra fast NOSQL database, MongoDB.

kwikPal is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, native JavaScript `Date` object was employed to format timestamps.

Seed data is provided and a walkthrough video that demonstrates functionality of kwikPal is also made available.  A link to the video will be added to the README when this app is complete.
